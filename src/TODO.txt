- Figure out if there's a way we can implement BCs which doesn't leave the Jacobian singular
- Factor out fluxes into functions which return SVectors
- Reimplement reconstruction
- See if we can try out DiffEqOperators or otherwise avoid recomputing stencil on each iteration
- move to edge-centered discretization for simplicity
- try merging update_electron_energy into update_heavy_species to avoid recomputing stuff

DONE
- Try central differences on electron energy
- Compute mu within update_electron_energy!
- compute electron velocity within update_electron_energy!
- test breathing mode and larger timesteps
    - 2e-9 works for all cases with SSPRK22 and 50 cells but there begin to be wiggles on left boundary
    - 3e-9 breaks
    - at 2e-9 timestep, SSPRK22 takes 15-20 seconds to integrate 1ms
    - case 2 and 3 are still off for some reason
    - Oscillations still damped out
