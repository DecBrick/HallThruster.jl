- See if we can try out DiffEqOperators or otherwise avoid recomputing stencil on each iteration
- move to edge-centered discretization for simplicity
- try merging update_electron_energy into update_heavy_species to avoid recomputing stuff
- make tests pass / make new tests
- local coverage
- end-to-end MMS
- remove unused parts
- try out no time derivative of Te

IN PROGRESS
- Figure out if there's a way we can implement BCs which doesn't leave the Jacobian singular
- Compute nabla pe and nabla phi in electronenergy
- make potential work with BC cache
- make electron energy work with BC cache

(ALL BENCHMARKS WITH 50 CELLS)
DONE
- Try central differences on electron energy
- Compute mu within update_electron_energy!
- compute electron velocity within update_electron_energy! (this was not actually done, lmao)
- test breathing mode and larger timesteps
    - 2e-9 works for all cases with SSPRK22 and 50 cells but there begin to be wiggles on left boundary
    - 3e-9 breaks
    - at 2e-9 timestep, SSPRK22 takes 15-20 seconds to integrate 1ms (integrated rusanov)
    - case 2 and 3 are still off for some reason
    - Oscillations still damped out
- Factor out fluxes into functions which return SVectors
    - 3e-9 and 4e-9 work now (no longer for some reason)
    - at 2e-9 timestep, 1ms with SSPRK22 now takes 18 seconds with HLLE, 17.5 seconds with rusanov
    - case 3 still off, case 2 not tried yet
    - case 1 now has strong transit time oscillations with HLLE and SSPRK43
- Muladd macro
    - no change, tested and removed
- try actually computing electron velocity within update_electron_energy!
    - ruins timestep, no change in solution
- rate coefficient fit function
    - saves like 1/4 of the computation time, minor diffs from LANDMARK tho
