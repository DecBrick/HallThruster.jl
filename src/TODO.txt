- Try central differences on electron energy
- Compute mu within update_electron_energy!
- compute electron velocity within update_electron_energy!
- Figure out if there's a way we can implement BCs which doesn't leave the Jacobian singular
- Factor out fluxes into functions which return SVectors
- Reimplement reconstruction
- See if we can try out DiffEqOperators or otherwise avoid recomputing stencil on each iteration
- move to edge-centered discretization for simplicity
- try merging update_electron_energy into update_heavy_species to avoid recomputing stuff
