	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The current status and challenges of the discharge plasma modeling capabilities in Hall effect thrusters (HETs) are reviewed. Partially magnetized plasmas in HETs present unique physics in that collisions with neutral atoms (a feature of low-temperature plasmas) and instabilities and oscillations (a feature of high-temperature plasmas) coexist. A discharge plasma model is constructed by choosing the numerical methods, e.g. fluid or kinetic, for individual plasma constituents, including neutral atoms, ions, and electrons. The governing equations, boundary conditions, and collision models of a xenon discharge plasma in HETs are discussed. Various models are used to illustrate device-scale phenomena, including the breathing mode and azimuthally rotating spokes, as well as small-scale physics, such as the electron cyclotron drift instability and current-carrying instability that may occur in a hollow cathode plume.}

@article{boeuf1998,
abstract = {Stationary plasma thrusters are ion thrusters whose properties make them especially suitable for satellite station keeping or orbit transfer. In these thrusters, a magnetic field transverse to the electron flow towards the anode increases the electron collision frequency and makes possible the generation of a plasma at relatively low gas flow and gas.density. The decrease of the plasma conductivity due to the magnetic field induces a large electric field in the plasma which accelerates the quasicollisionless ions whose trajectories are not significantly affected by the magnetic field. The purpose of this article is to clarify, using results from a simple model, the electrical properties of these thrusters and the low frequency oscillation regime which has been observed experimentally. The model is based on the assumption of quasineutrality of the plasma column and on a 1D transient hybrid treatment of electron and ion transport in the device. Electrons are considered as a fluid and ions are described with a collisionless kinetic equation. This model provides reasonable estimates of the plasma properties and is able to give a clear picture of the low frequency oscillations, qualitatively close to the experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Fluid models of gas discharges require the input of transport coefficients and rate coefficients that depend on the electron energy distribution function. Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron–neutral collisions and electron–electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations.}

	abstract = {As mathematical computing becomes more democratized in high-level languages, high-performance symbolic-numeric systems are necessary for domain scientists and engineers to get the best performance out of their machine without deep knowledge of code optimization. Naturally, users need different term types either to have different algebraic properties for them, or to use efficient data structures. To this end, we developed Symbolics.jl, an extendable symbolic system which uses dynamic multiple dispatch to change behavior depending on the domain needs. In this work we detail an underlying abstract term interface which allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by formalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can retroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the pre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term construction and give a 113x acceleration on general symbolic transformations. Further, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary term-rewriting implementations. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate the ability to swap between classical term-rewriting simplifiers and e-graph-based term-rewriting simplifiers. We illustrate how this symbolic system improves numerical computing tasks by showcasing an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU cycles during expression evaluation, and demonstrate how it simplifies a real-world reaction-network simulation to halve the runtime. Additionally, we show a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation solver which is able to be automatically converted into symbolic expressions via multiple dispatch tracing, which is subsequently accelerated and parallelized to give a 157x simulation speedup. Together, this presents Symbolics.jl as a next-generation symbolic-numeric computing environment geared towards modeling and simulation.},
