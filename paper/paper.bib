	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The current status and challenges of the discharge plasma modeling capabilities in Hall effect thrusters (HETs) are reviewed. Partially magnetized plasmas in HETs present unique physics in that collisions with neutral atoms (a feature of low-temperature plasmas) and instabilities and oscillations (a feature of high-temperature plasmas) coexist. A discharge plasma model is constructed by choosing the numerical methods, e.g. fluid or kinetic, for individual plasma constituents, including neutral atoms, ions, and electrons. The governing equations, boundary conditions, and collision models of a xenon discharge plasma in HETs are discussed. Various models are used to illustrate device-scale phenomena, including the breathing mode and azimuthally rotating spokes, as well as small-scale physics, such as the electron cyclotron drift instability and current-carrying instability that may occur in a hollow cathode plume.}

	abstract = {Fluid models of gas discharges require the input of transport coefficients and rate coefficients that depend on the electron energy distribution function. Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron–neutral collisions and electron–electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations.}
